QUESTION 4


++ Statistics after my optimised selection
Signal histogram entries 58772 expected events 162.8
Background histogram entries 51369 expected events 710.4
Total S/sqrt(S+B) improved from 5.17 to 5.51


QUESTION 5

The value obtained for mu-hat is 3.60.

The value obtained for q0 is 377.18.

Based on the mu-hat and q0 values, since the mu-hat is > 1 and q0 >> 0, we can argue that the background + signal is the most likely.
Recall that mu-hat is the Maximum-likelihood estimate for mu and it measures the signal strength. In case it was 0, we had no signal; however, that is not the case (mu-hat is 3.60!).
